# Quine-McCluskey-Algorithm
Quine-McCluskey Algorithm for any lengths of boolean functions

This program is basically developed and simulated on Windows 10 64bits. If u insert any lengths of minterms with representated by digital number, This program will output the minimized boolean function and the number of transistors u needed to make that circuit.
